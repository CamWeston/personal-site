             Natureventures is an exciting social media app that is exclusive to college students and allows them to get outdoors and meet new people. When a user joins Natureventures they gain instant access to "The Wall". Here, all users at the university can post pictures of their outings, from mountain biking to mountaneering. Users can comment and like each others posts. <br><br>

             The biggest feature that sets Natureventures apart from the crowd is the "TagAlong!" feature. Using "TagAlong!", users are able to post events like "Going skiing at Sugarbush, VT, on Saturday, who wants to come?". Once this is published, other users can press the tag along event to indicate they have interest, than can talk to each other in the comments to discuss a plan. Bottom line, "TagAlong!" gets students outside and making new friends.<br><br>

             <b>Natureventures uses a PHP backend, MySQL database, LDAP for security, and a pure CSS frontend.</b>
