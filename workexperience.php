          <h5>Software Engineer Intern</h5>
          <h6>May - September 2016</h6>
          <p class ='responsive-text'>Worked as a software development intern for an innovative incubator company, Productio Capital.
           I developed applications with the company from May until early September 2016.
           For the first few months of my employment I created a native desktop JAVA application that implemented SQL, user management, 
           simple but innovative GUI and much more. Developing this app allowed me to improve and showcase my skill-set of JAVA and 
           object orientated programming.

          In mid July I began developing a web application for Productio. 
          This app allows incubator companies to share files and easily manage their many start-up companies marketing plans. 
          The app is composed of PHP, bootstrap, SQL, JavaScript and a few more languages.
